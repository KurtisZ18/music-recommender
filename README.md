# Song Recommender App
Created using React.js, Django and Last.fm API. Search bar allowing users to enter songs and artists to find similar ones using Last.fm API's similarity finder. In my opinion, Last.fm gives great recommendations, however it is hard to access these recommendations without creating an account and creating several playlists that have their recommended songs for you inside. This application allows all users to find similar songs using Last.fm without creating an account or using their services.

Access at <https://kurtisz18.github.io/music-recommender/>. It can take a minute for the first query to load as the backend will become inactive without continuous usage.
